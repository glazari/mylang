# MyLang

A vary simple language to help me undertstand how to write a compiler.

Starting with just the assembly generation and automating some part of programming in assembly.
I think this will lead nicely into the start of a working compiler.


## Features

- [ ] Variables (integers)
- [ ] addition


## Example

```
var a = 1
var b = 2
```
